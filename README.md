# Text-replacement-sketch-plugin
A simple Sketch plugin for replacing strings with strings. I've been using it when creating specs for replacing hex colors created via "Copy CSS Attributes" with the corresponding LESS variable specified in our brand guidelines.

## How to
1. Open the plugin file and customize "repArray" to include one or more substitutions
2. Double click the plugin file to install it
3. Select some text layer containing one or more word to be substituted and run the plugin
